# MotiFinder

A stripped-down, follow-along to [ Predicting the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins by deep learning](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3300)

#### _k_-mer vs motif
AAAAAATTATATA==TATTT==AAAA  
- Highlighted part is the motif
- The entire sequence is the _k_-mer. Your input sequences are also _k_-mers. 

### _k_-mer size
I've randomly chosen the _k_-mer size as 500. You can change it by changing the `k_mer_size` definition in cell 9.  
You're also free to change the number of true and false datasets generated by changing the `data_size` value (True: Randomly generated _k_-mer contains your motif _at least_ once. False: the randomly generated _k_-mer has **no** instance of the motif. )
