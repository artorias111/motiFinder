# MotiFinder

A stripped-down, follow-along to [ Predicting the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins by deep learning](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3300)


#### Change the k-mer size:
I've randomly chosen the k-mer size as 500. You can change it by changing the `k_mer_size` definition in cell 9.  
You're also free to change the number of true and false datasets generated by changing the `data_size` value (True: Randomly generated _k_-mer contains your motif _at least_ once. False: the randomly generated _k_-mer has **no** instance of the motif. )
